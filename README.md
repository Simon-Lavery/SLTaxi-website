# SLTaxi-website

Welcome, this is my website I have built while learning web development. 

This is a live site that I use for my full time job while I am learning and I
am sure there are plenty of bugs to find, improvements to be made and lots of 
other things that could do with updating. [sltaxicatterick.co.uk](sltaxicatterick.co.uk)

I have uploaded the site as a way to practice with git and get experience
working with other developers. Any one from any skill level is welcome to 
submit pull requests, if you think I should be doing something different let
me know, or if you would like me to explain how I done something I could help 
you.


This is my first README file (advice welcome)

## Getting started

The site is built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node-js/express and ejs.

Just clone the repo
```
cd SLTaxi-website // cd into the directory
npm i             // install the dependencies
node index.js     // run the index.js file
```
I have started to convert the CSS to SCSS so this might be a beginer friendly place
to start. 

// DO NOT EDIT THE MAIN.CSS FILE DIRECTLY
Run sass --watch public/css/main.scss public/css/main.css

The only thing I have commented out is the Sendgrid API so the email form
won't work, other than that the website should be running on localhost:4000
